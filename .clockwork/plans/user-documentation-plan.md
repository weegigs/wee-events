## Documentation Standards

### README Template
Each package README should include:
1. Package name and description
2. Installation instructions
3. Quick start example
4. Key concepts and features
5. API overview with common use cases
6. Configuration options
7. Integration with other packages
8. Troubleshooting section
9. Contributing guidelines
10. License information

### Code Examples
- Must be executable and tested
- Include necessary imports
- Show both TypeScript and JavaScript usage
- Demonstrate error handling
- Include comments explaining key concepts

### Cross-Package Consistency
- Use consistent terminology across all documentation
- Link between related packages
- Maintain a glossary of terms
- Version compatibility matrix

## Implementation Strategy (Revised)

### Phase 1: Core Examples (High Priority)
1. âœ… Basic event-sourced aggregate example - Complete
2. ðŸ”„ HTTP API with Fastify example - In Progress 
3. Encrypted event storage example
4. Comprehensive testing strategies example

### Phase 2: Documentation Based on Examples (Medium Priority)
1. Create README for @weegigs/events-core based on working examples
2. Create README for @weegigs/dynamo-event-store based on examples and patterns
3. Create README for @weegigs/events-effects based on working patterns
4. Create README for @weegigs/events-common covering utilities used in examples
5. Create README for @weegigs/events-cypher based on encryption example
6. Create README for @weegigs/events-fastify based on HTTP API example

### Phase 3: Advanced Guides (Low Priority)
1. Write 'Getting Started with Event Sourcing' guide using examples as foundation
2. Write 'Building Your First Event-Sourced Service' tutorial based on basic example
3. Write 'Testing Event-Sourced Applications' guide based on testing example

### Phase 4: Infrastructure & Tooling (Low Priority)
1. Configure TypeDoc for monorepo and set up API documentation generation
2. Set up GitHub Pages and automate API documentation publishing in CI/CD
3. Create README for tools/events CLI based on usage patterns
4. Create glossary of event sourcing and Wee Events specific terms

## Success Metrics
- All packages have comprehensive READMEs based on working examples
- Core working examples covering essential use cases
- API documentation is auto-generated and published
- User guides cover the complete development lifecycle
- Documentation is searchable and well-indexed

## Rationale for Examples-First Approach
**Why Examples Before Documentation:**
1. **Real-world patterns** - Documentation reflects actual working code
2. **Tested examples** - Everything is validated before being documented  
3. **Practical guidance** - Users can copy working implementations
4. **Accurate documentation** - No theoretical concepts without proof
5. **Faster iteration** - Examples reveal gaps in understanding quickly

## Maintenance Plan
- Review and update documentation with each release
- Monitor GitHub issues for documentation gaps
- Regularly test all code examples
- Keep API documentation in sync with code changes
- Maintain a documentation changelog

## Complexity Assessment
**High Complexity** - This project requires:
- Deep understanding of each package's functionality
- Creating numerous tested examples
- Ensuring consistency across all documentation
- Setting up automated documentation generation
- Coordinating with existing documentation patterns
